"Found in nature," in this context, does not necessarily mean found in a natural space or untouched by humans; it simply means that you must find the rocks yourself, and cannot buy them.`,

If a restaurant associates itself with multiple countries, or a region larger than a single country (such as an "Asian" restaurant), it cannot be used for this curse.

You may not, however, ban the question that has just been asked, even if you have not yet answered it. Questions removed from the game using this curse cannot be asked, even for increased cost.`,

		bylaws: `The egg can be from any type of animal, but it must be a real egg (a chocolate egg or a plastic egg, for example, would not count.) Any visible fracture, however small, counts as killing the egg. If you do not want to buy items during the course of your game, or object to this curse on ethical grounds, this curse should be removed from the deck. For any other curse that requires all seekers to do something, the egg counts as a seeker. For example, using the Curse of the Lemon Phylactery after this curse has been played would require the egg to have a lemon attached to it.`,

If you accidentally hit someone with a die, I am awarded a (S 10) (M 20) (L 30) minute bonus.`,
		bylaws: `100 feet is measured parallel to the ground. The die can, and likely should, be rolled on an inclined surface. If the die is lost or does not land cleanly on one side, it cannot be counted. Any bonuses awarded to the hider should be delivered immediately.`,

		bylaws: `The die rolled for this curse must be a d6. If there are multiple seekers, seekers may choose to roll independently or have one die dictate steps for all seekers at once; either is acceptable. If seekers accidentally take extra steps, they should stop and roll the die retroactively until they have made up for all the unaccounted steps.

		bylaws: `Any object or display whose primary purpose is to raise awareness of a product, service, or business counts as an advertisement. If the advertisement is for a specific service, such as a massage, the seekers must pay for and receive the service advertised. If the advertisement is for a location but not a specific service, such as an amusement park, the seekers must enter that location. Locations that are not private businesses, such as a public park, do not count. If you do not want to be forced to potentially spend money to fulfill this curse, it should be removed from the deck.`,

If you do not roll a 7 or higher, you cannot enter that space (including through other doorways.) Any given doorway can be re-attempted after (S 5) (M 10) (L 15) minutes.`,
		bylaws: `Seekers must roll two d6 dice. Dice can only be rolled to enter a doorway once the doorway is visible to the seekers. For example, if you are attempting to roll to enter a train, you cannot roll the dice before the train arrives; you must be able to see the train door first. Doorways within a building that lead to other parts of the same building, such as a store within a train station, do not need to pass a dice check. If there is any reasonable dispute as to whether something counts as a seperate building, err on the side of doing a dice check.

Your time limit begins from the moment you draw your first line; time spent gathering materials does not count. You may discard your maze and start drawing a new maze at any point, but you cannot restart your timer. You may not consult the internet or any other materials when drawing your maze; it must come entirely from your own head.`,

Use the MSRP of the car, factoring it its year of production, and disregarding any add-ons or modifications that may have been paid for. (For example: upgrades to the car's interior, special tires, custom colors, etc.) The photo sent to the seekers must include enough of the car for it to be identifiable. All of these rules also apply to the car found by the seekers. If you cannot confirm a car's exact production year or exact model, both sides must come to a consensus on which model and year to use for determining price.`,

You must go there, and spend at least (S 5) (M 5) (L 10) minutes there, before asking another question. You must send me at least three photos of you enjoying your vacation, and procure an object to bring to me as a souvenir. If this souvenir is lost before you can give it to me, I am awarded an extra (S 30) (M 45) (L 60) minutes.`,
		bylaws: `"Publicly accessible" in this context follows the same rules as "publicly accessible" in the context of hiding spots. The destination does not need to be a single point; it can be a small general area like a park or store. The souvenir can be literally any physical object.

		bylaws: `You cannot begin fulfilling the casting cost of this curse if you would be otherwise unable to play a curse; once the cost is fulfilled, this curse must be cast immediately. The printed material cannot be printed by the seekers; the letters should be gathered from magazines, newspapers, or any other material that the seekers encounter in the wild. "Coherence" in this context does not necessarily mean complete sentences, but the hider should be able to discern the meaning of the question without further clarification. You may use easy-to-understand abbreviations for certain words (such as "2" instead of "to.") If the question requires additional context outside of the basic sentence itself, this context does NOT need to be provided in the form of a ransom note. For example, if you are asking a thermometer question, you can simply ask something along the lines of, "Went 5 miles. Hotter/colder?" Any information about where you started and ended the thermometer can be provided as normal, in the form of a location pin or text.`,

A right turn is defined as a road at any angle that veers to the right of you.`,

This category remains disabled until the next question is asked, at which point a die is rolled again to choose a new category. The same category can be disabled multiple times in a row.`,
		bylaws: `The seekers should assign die numbers to each category before their first roll. For small-sized games, which only include five categories of questions, a six would result in a reroll.`,

		bylaws: `"Next Station," in this context, refers to the next station that the seekers' current mode of transit will stop at; if there are any stops along the line that their current route will skip, those should be disregarded. If you are not sure whether the seekers are on transit, or whether their route will stop at a particular station, you may ask them for that information. If there is any ambiguity, you should tell them what you believe their next station is when this curse is cast to confirm that you didn't misread their tracker. Even if the seekers' current mode of transit would eventually bring them closer to you, this curse may still be played so long as their next station is further; a line that heads in your direction but temporarily curves away is a particularly advantageous situation for this curse.`,

The water may be distributed between the seekers as you see fit. If the liquid is lost or abandoned at any point after aquisition, I am awarded a (S 30) (M 30) (L 60) minute bonus.`,
		bylaws: `Any liquid already traveling with the seekers at the time that this card is played (e.g. water bottles) does not count. The liquid can be in any number of containers, and can be passed back and forth between the seekers at any time. The liquid can be sat down when the seekers are stationary or on transit, but it is considered "abandoned" once it is no longer within 10 feet of any seeker. The hider must be informed of their bonus immediately. "Body of water" within this context does not necessarily mean natural, but it cannot be a pool and must be large enough to be marked on the map.`,

		bylaws: `"Bug" in this context refers to any insect, arachnid, diplopoda, chilopoda, or anything else that would be colloquially and commonly referred to as a "bug". "Wild" in this context means undomesticated and not kept in human captivity, including large-scale outdoor instances of captivity, such as farms or sanctuaries. The photo must include enough of the animal to be recognizable within its category. If there is any dispute as to an animal's classification, defer to Wikipedia. Animals outside of any of these categories (such as crustaceans) cannot be used for this curse.`,

		bylaws: `The move powerup, if played at the right moment, can be one of the most powerful cards in the game. When played, you are granted a certain amount of time based on game size to establish a new hiding zone. The rules for finding a new hiding zone apply as usual; you must center yourself on a new transit station, and you can only use valid transit to reach your new location. While you move, your hiding timer is paused, and the seekers must stay where they are and refrain from asking questions until the move timer is up. At this point, the game resumes, and your hiding timer continues from where it was at the moment you played the move powerup. It is crucial to do this at the perfect moment, as playing the move comes at a severe costâ€“you must immediately discard your entire hand and inform the seekers of your original transit station after playing it. Given that the move cannot be played during the end game, this means that you must be confident that the seekers are close to finding you, and that you are better off starting from scratch instead of using the cards you've already accumulated over the course of your round.

After the seekers have been informed that you have used a randomize powerup, they must chooseâ€“at random, either using a random number generator or diceâ€“a different unasked question from the same category (e.g. a 10 mile radar might become a 50 mile radar.) This question is then automatically asked instead, and you provide an answer as normal. The original question is not considered to have been asked, and can therefore be asked again for its original cost. If the randomize causes a question to be asked that returns a null answer, this is permitted (tough luck, though).

The question is still considered to have been asked, and therefore can only be asked again for its additional cost. Since you have not answered their question, however, you are given no reward and do not draw any cards from the hider deck.
